# Surface Dust Storm dataset (SDS):
# Mars Dust Image Dataset

## 1. Description

This dataset contains a collection of images representing Martian surface conditions under varying levels of dust coverage. The dataset is intended to support research in planetary surface change detection, dust storm modeling, computer vision under harsh visual conditions, and unsupervised change detection. Each image reflects different dust intensities captured from simulated or processed Martian satellite imagery.

## 2. Platform

The dataset can be used on any platform that supports standard image processing tools, including:

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS

## 3. Environment

To work with the dataset and associated scripts, the following environment is recommended:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, Ubuntu 18.04+, macOS Monterey+
- **Python Version**: 3.7 or higher

### Required Libraries

- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 4. Major Component Description

The dataset contains the following components:

- **SDS.zip**: Different Martian dust images.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

## The SDS datasets used in this work are processed and produced by Ground Research and Application System (GRAS) of China's Lunar and Planetary Exploration Program, they can be applied and downloaded at {http://moon.bao.ac.cn/}.
